# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Predicting health insurance charges with Scikit-Learn. Improved model $R^2$ from 0.14 to 0.77 using data preprocessing and polynomial feature engineering."
You can use this structure to explain the "Engineering" behind your code:The ProblemHealthcare providers and insurers need accurate tools to estimate medical costs.1 Traditional linear models often fail to capture the complex relationship between lifestyle choices (like smoking) and health metrics (like BMI).The SolutionThis project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model developed in Python. The workflow includes:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and identifying non-linear relationships.Feature Engineering: Implementing Polynomial Features ($BMI^2$) to better model the exponential cost increase seen in high-BMI smokers.Data Pipeline: Standardizing continuous variables and encoding categorical data to ensure feature importance is calculated fairly.
